# Your container build

This directory is provided to try and provide an easy way for you to build your own custom container.

First you must copy your publicly verifiable cert/key PEM file into this directory as the file `certkey.pem`

Then run `./dkmk` - this will prompt you to create a username & password for your `rest/api` service, 
before creating your container as `my_epprest`
